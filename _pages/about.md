I am a PhD Student  under supervision of Prof. Dr. Laura Kallmeyer and Prof. Dr. Wiebke Petersen at the University of D端sseldorf in Germany. In my dissertation project I develop a frame-semantic parser for French based on the framework of Tree-Adjoining-Grammars (TAG) and Neural TAG supertagging.

My dissertation is part of the [TreeGraSP](https://treegrasp.phil.hhu.de) project.

My research interests include
------
- Computational Semantics, Frame Semantics, Compositional Semantics
- Semantic Parsing, Parsing beyond context-free grammars
- Machine Learning, Deep Learning
- Natural Language Understanding, Text Generation with Neural Networks,Neural Semantic Parsing
- Syntax-Semantics Interface
- Tree Adjoining Grammars (TAG), TAG induction, Supertagging
- Role and Reference Grammar (RRG)
