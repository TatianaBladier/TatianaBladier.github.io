From October 2024, I am a posdoctoral computational linguist at the [Laboratoire d’Informatique et Systèmes (LIS)](https://talep.lis-lab.fr/) of the [Aix-Marseille University](https://www.univ-amu.fr/) in Marseille, France. I am co-working on the [COMPO project](https://anr.fr/Project-ANR-23-CE23-0031) which investigates inductive biases for compositionality-capable Deep Learning Models of Natural Language. My supervisor is [Prof. Dr. Alexis Nasr](https://pageperso.lis-lab.fr/alexis.nasr/).

Before this (from 2017 to 2024) I was a PhD Student under supervision of [Prof. Dr. Laura Kallmeyer](https://user.phil.hhu.de/kallmeyer/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and [Prof. Dr. Wiebke Petersen](https://user.phil.hhu.de/~petersen/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} at the University of Düsseldorf in Germany. In my dissertation project I developed a frame-semantic parser for English, French, German, and Russian based on [Role and Reference Grammar](https://rrg.caset.buffalo.edu/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, Tree Rewriting Grammars and neural networks. My dissertation was part of the [TreeGraSP](https://treegrasp.phil.hhu.de){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} project at the University of Düsseldorf, Germany.
