I am a PhD Student  under supervision of [Prof. Dr. Laura Kallmeyer](https://user.phil.hhu.de/kallmeyer/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and [Prof. Dr. Wiebke Petersen](https://user.phil.hhu.de/~petersen/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} at the University of Düsseldorf in Germany. In my dissertation project I develop a frame-semantic parser for English, French, German, and Russian based on [Role and Reference Grammar](https://rrg.caset.buffalo.edu/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, Tree Rewriting Grammars and neural networks.

My dissertation is part of the [TreeGraSP](https://treegrasp.phil.hhu.de){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} project at the University of Düsseldorf, Germany.
