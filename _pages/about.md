From October 2024, I am a postdoctoral computational linguist at the [Laboratoire d'Informatique et Systèmes (LIS)](https://talep.lis-lab.fr/) of [Aix-Marseille University](https://www.univ-amu.fr/) in Marseille, France. My research focuses on semantic parsing, compositional semantics, and developing neural approaches that integrate linguistic structure into natural language processing.

Currently, I am working on the [COMPO project](https://anr.fr/Project-ANR-23-CE23-0031), which investigates inductive biases for compositionality-capable deep learning models of natural language, under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Alexis Nasr](https://pageperso.lis-lab.fr/alexis.nasr/).

I completed my PhD at the University of Düsseldorf in Germany (2017-2024) under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Laura Kallmeyer](https://user.phil.hhu.de/kallmeyer/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and [Prof. Dr. Wiebke Petersen](https://user.phil.hhu.de/~petersen/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. My dissertation developed a frame-semantic parser for English, French, German, and Russian based on [Role and Reference Grammar](https://rrg.caset.buffalo.edu/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, tree rewriting grammars, and neural networks. This work was part of the [TreeGraSP](https://treegrasp.phil.hhu.de){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} project.


Research Interests
------
I work at the intersection of computational semantics, grammar formalisms, and neural approaches to NLP. Specific areas include:

**Semantic Parsing & Understanding**
- Frame semantics and compositional semantics
- Neural semantic parsing and natural language understanding
- Syntax-semantics interface

**Grammar Formalisms & Parsing**
- Tree Adjoining Grammars (TAG) and Tree Wrapping Grammar (TWG)
- Parsing beyond context-free grammars
- Grammar induction and supertagging
- Role and Reference Grammar (RRG)

**Neural & Deep Learning Approaches**
- Large language models
- Deep learning for natural language processing
- Text generation with neural networks
